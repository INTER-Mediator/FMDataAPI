## At a Glance

The FileMaker database named "TestDB.fmp12" is hosted on localhost, and
it sets the "fmrest" as access privilege. The account to connect with REST API is "web"
and "password." This database has the layout named "person_layout," and you
can use the layout name as a property of the FMDataAPI instance. The return
value of the "query" method is Iterator and can repeat in the foreach statement
with each record in the query result. This layout has the field named
"FamilyName" and "GivenName," and can use the field name as a property.

```
$fmdb = new FMDataAPI("TestDB", "web", "password");
$result = $fmdb->person_layout->query();
foreach ($result as $record) {
    echo "name: {$record->FamilyName}, {$record->GivenName}";
}
```

For more details, I'd like to read codes and comments in file samples/FMDataAPI_Sample.php.

## What's This?

The FileMaker Data API is the new feature of FileMaker Server 16,
and it's the API with REST-based database operations.
Although the Custom Web Publishing is the way to access the database
for a long while, FileMaker Inc. has introduced the modern feature to operate
the database. The current version of FMDataAPI works on just FileMaker 18 and 19 platform.

For now, I'm focusing on developing the web application framework "INTER-Mediator"
(https://inter-mediator.com/ or https://github.com/INTER-Mediator/INTER-Mediator.git)
which can develop the core features of database-driven web application
with declarative descriptions. INTER-Mediator has already supported the Custom
Web Publishing with FX.php, and I develop codes here for support REST APIs.

Bug reports and contributions are welcome.
